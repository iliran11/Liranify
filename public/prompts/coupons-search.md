# Goal  
Find **active Israeli coupons** for food, restaurants, movies, theatres, and wellness activities valid in the **next month**.  

# Value Proposition  
Deliver a **curated list of truly worthwhile deals** — not filler offers — that provide **real monetary value or unique experiences**.  

Exclude fake-value offers, for example:  
> A restaurant requiring you to buy two full-price meals just to get a small dessert or drink for free.  

The goal is to save users time by filtering out such misleading promotions.
